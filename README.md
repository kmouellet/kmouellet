## Background

### Career

I've been working at the University of Alberta for over **12 years** in various roles:
1. Admissions Advisor *in the Registrar's Office*
2. Records Advisor *in the Registrar's Office*
3. Faculty Advisor *in the Faculty of Science*
4. Functional Analyst *in the College of Natural and Applied Science* (present)

I've been fortunate enough to learn a lot about this institution and only in my current role has it lead me down to being able to dive more into technology.

### Education

Completed by Bachelor of Arts in Sociology and Drama at the University of Alberta back in 2008. 

Thought that Sociology would help me with getting more into the law enforcement world, but alas poor yorick...tis was not meant to be

If you hadn't guessed, I was and am a huge Drama geek!!!

## Tech Hobbies and Experience

At the moment my experience with technology is what I do for work and this class. I'm working towards the Full Stack Web Development diploma and this is my first 'coding' type class. I did EXSM 3921 which was UI Design. That was a lot of fun and it tapped into my creative side.

I haven't started any tech hobbies yet since I'm still quite new to this type of industry, but the more I learn the more confortable I'll feel to work on something.

For work the technology experiences I have are mostly to do with scripting in Google Apps Editor for Google Sheets and Google Docs. I'm learning a lot from Youtube or ChatGPT (or equivalencies). Just piecing parts together.

I only recently discovered that ChatGPT was more then just helping with essay writing, it also helped with troubleshooting errors in the apps scripts that I was creating. Some of the Javascript used I'm slowly understanding, but a lot of it still seems foreign to me so it's a work in progress.

Looking forward to learning more throughout this diploma program.
